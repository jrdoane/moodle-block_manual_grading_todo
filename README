Supported Moodle versions:
    * 1.9.5+ (Build: 20090701)

Introduction:
    This is a Moodle block that assists a teacher by finding all the manually
    gradable assessments in their course (this currently includes course modules
    from the quiz and assignment modules.)

    This is primarily useful in institutions/courses with rolling enrollments,
    when the teacher doesn't know that a student may have submitted new work.

Installation:
    Copy the contents of the github tree directly into
    /path/to/moodle/blocks/block_manual_grading_todo and run the admin/index.php
    script from your web browser. Example: http://www.somemoodle.org/admin/

    After you install, remember to add the block everywhere you want to see it!
